        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi there! I'm Abdul Haadi, a passionate Software Engineer and Web Developer based in Pakistan. With a strong background in computer science and a knack for problem-solving, I enjoy turning ideas into reality through coding.</p>
        <p>My journey into the world of software engineering started in SSUET and Skillship Program played key role to groom my skills. Since then, I've been continuously learning and honing my skills to stay updated with the latest technologies and trends in the industry.</p>
        <p>As a Web Developer, I specialize in building responsive and user-friendly websites and web applications. I have experience working with various programming languages, frameworks, and tools such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular, Nest.js, and more.</p>
        <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me chilling or playing sports. I believe in the power of continuous learning and collaboration, and I'm always eager to take on new challenges and projects.</p>
        <p>Feel free to explore my portfolio to see some of my work, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or opportunities for collaboration!</p>
